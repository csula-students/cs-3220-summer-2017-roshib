# Java EE Web Application Starter with Gradle

This is the starter set to start Java EE application development with Gradle using
Gretty.

## Get Started

You can run `gradle appRun` to start application and go to http://localhost:8080/hello
to see HelloServlet being ran!

You can start adding more Java Servlets under `src/main/java` folder to continue
hacking!

## File Structure

```
src/main/java                   -> Your java classes
	edu/csula/HelloServlet.java -> HelloServlet for example
build.gradle                    -> necessary gradle definition
build/                          -> built files
	classes                     -> compiled java classes
```
